# Machine_Learning_with_Smiley_Dataset

## A number of machine learning techniques are applied to the smiley dataset for classification.
* Data preparation and analysis as well as application of bayesian methods
* Unsupervised Learning and Clustering (EM, Hierarchical clusterings, silhouette)
* Supervised Learning methods including Naive Bayes, Linear Regression,  K-nearest neighbours and Decision trees.
* Neural Network and Convolutional Neural Networks
